SELECT user_id, nickname,
    CONCAT(city, " ", street_address1, " ", street_address2) AS 전체주소,

    CONCAT(substr(tlno, 1, 3), "-", substr(tlno, 4, 4), "-", substr(tlno, 8, 4)) AS "전화번호"
    FROM used_goods_user

        SELECT writer_id
            FROM used_goods_board
            GROUP BY writer_id
